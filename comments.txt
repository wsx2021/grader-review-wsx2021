	•	I like the simplicity of their code
	•	It’s nice that grade doesn’t pass if compilation fails, tells us the grade in all cases
	•	Not entirely sure if the filter test is supposed to be a compile error
	•	I like that it told us which file was missing, though maybe a little too specific to only checking for ListExamples
	•	Pretty sure nested case should tell us that they can’t find the file
	•	Perhaps it may be better if partial pass is echoed if the amount of fails is less than the amount of runs, rather than if it’s 1 or not.
